This GitHub repository contains a Python-based slot machine simulator. The simulator emulates the experience of playing a slot machine with customizable parameters, including the number of lines to bet on, betting amount, and the symbols' probabilities and values. The program allows players to deposit an initial balance, place bets, and simulate spins, and it provides feedback on winnings and overall balance. The simulator is built using Python and employs randomization for generating slot machine outcomes.
